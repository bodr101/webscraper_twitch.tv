# webscraper_twitch.tv
This GitHub repository includes a python code that scrapes the "about" pages of Twitch streamers in certain categories. The code includes a scroll function, a click function and other smaller additions that document the scraping process.

The code can be run, entirely top-down, in Jupyter Notebook. 

Feel free to reach out to us if there are any questions about the code by sending an email to:
